# Vim Elvis

## Installation
There are a few ways you can go about installing this plugin:

1.  If you have [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) you can simply add:
    ```vim
    Plugin 'ntpeters/vim-elvis'
    ```
    to your `.vimrc` file then run:
    ```vim
    :PluginInstall
    ```
2.  If you are using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), you can just run the following command:
    ```
    git clone git://github.com/ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-elvis
    ```
3.  While this plugin can also be installed by copying its contents into your `~/.vim/` directory, I would
    highly recommend using one of the above methods as they make managing your Vim plugins painless.
